        Polar bears are one of the most well-known animals that live in the snow. These massive creatures can weigh up to 600 kilograms and are expert swimmers! They spend most of their time traveling on the ice, looking for mates and hunting for seals, which they eat for food.

Polar bears have thick fur and a layer of fat under their skin that keeps them warm in the coldest environments. They live in areas where the temperature can drop as low as -40 degrees Celsius!

Female polar bears have increased maternal instincts and make sure their cubs are well taken care of, groom them often and keep them warm.

        Bobcats are a species of Lynx often found in North America. They are twice the size of a domestic cat. Humans seldom see bobcats because they’re nocturnal animals. They’re also very good at hunting in the snow and can take down prey much larger than themselves.

        Bobcats are also excellent climbers and can climb trees to escape predators or to get a better view of their surroundings. They roam around in many habitats, from deserts to swamps, and forests to suburban areas. Bobcats prey on hares and rabbits but also hunt deer, birds, insects, and small rodents.

            Artic Foxes

    Artic foxes are small to medium-sized canids native to the Northern Hemisphere and Arctic regions. They typically range in size from 46 to 68 cm (18 to 27 inches). They have large triangular ears, short muzzles, and long legs relative to their body size.

Arctic foxes are well adapted to living in cold environments. Their dense fur coats range in color from silver-gray to brown-red based on the season, with white underbellies.

Arctic fox feet are bushy with furry soles that protect them from the cold and help them move quietly over snow. Their fur coats keep them warm in temperatures as low as −58°F (−50°C), and their furry soles help insulate them against the cold ground.

They also have a high metabolism that helps keep them warm. Arctic foxes are proficient hunters, feeding primarily on lemmings and voles. They also eat birds, eggs, and carrion.

    <p>
        Musk oxen are built for the cold. They have a thick coat of fur and an insulating undercoat that helps protect them from the cold Arctic winter. They can also find food in the snow, using their sharp hooves to dig through the ice and snow to find grasses, roots, tundra, and mosses.Musk oxen are related to sheep and goats, and they were first discovered by European explorers in the 1600s. They’re primarily found in Arctic Greenland and Canada.

        They live in herds and often hurdle close together to generate heat and stay warm. Additionally, they have long, curved horns for protection against predators.

        Sika deer, also known as Japanese deer or spotted deer, is a type of deer native to East Asia. However, the Sika deer were introduced to other parts of the world and can now be found in Canada, the UK, some parts of Europe, and the U.S.Because they’re quite flexible, they are among the few species of deer that can tolerate cold weather. During winter, sika deer often grows thicker fur coat that keeps them warm in freezing temperatures.

        They also have hooves that are well-adapted to walking on snow and digging through it for food like grass and bamboo. When the winter is too harsh, these deer often adapt quickly and depend on other food sources, such as tree bark. Thanks to their highly adapted digestive systems, sika deers can gain nutrition from the tree barks.

        The snow leopard is a large cat native to the cold, dry mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. They live in altitudes between 9800 feet and 17,000 feet.

Their most distinctive feature is their thick, soft, gray, yellowish, or white fur coat. They also have brown or black spots on their bodies that are used for camouflage when hunting in the snow.

The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The total population of snow leopards is estimated at between 4000 and 7000 individuals living in the wild and 700 living in captivity. Snow leopards typically live between 15 and 18 years in captivity.
